# Computer-graphics-and-virtual-reality
Computer graphics and virtual reality in C++ and Open GL. 
All these excercises are practical work carried out during the IGR course of Télécom Paris.

## Solar System implementation
The objective of this exercise is to develop an interactive graphics application using modern OpenGL (version 3.3 and later). The goal is to implement a small artificial solar system.

## Shadow Mapping
The final goal is to implement two real-time rendering techniques: normal mapping and shadow
mapping. This exercise starts with a provided codebase where basic libraries such as a 3D vector and matrix as well as simple rendering routine are already implemented.

## Rigid body simulation
This excercise show how to implement a basic rigid body simulator in three-dimensional (3D) space. This exercise starts with a provided codebase where basic libraries such as a 3D vector and matrix as well as simple rendering routine are already implemented.

## Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Simulation
This excercise show how to implement a basic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulator for liquid animations in
two-dimensional (2D) space. This exercise starts with a provided codebase where basic math libraries such as 2D vector and cubic
spline function as well as a simple rendering routine are already implemented.
